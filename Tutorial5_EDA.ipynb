    "This is the first step in Data analysis and it is extremely important that we understand what columns our dataset has and how many of them are necessary to reach the goal of the project. This brings us to understnding the problem statement of our project. We are using this dataset to focus on the host's point of view. If you are a host and you have a home in New York City that you wish to rent out to travellers, Airbnb gives you the platform. Our problem statement is to predict the price of a particular home at a specific location in New York City, so that it helps the host in setting a price for his/her home. This will be done taking various factors into consideration.\n",
